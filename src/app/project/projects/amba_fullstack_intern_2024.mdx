## Overview

Development of multiple internal fullstack applications for data analytics using interactive graphs and charts.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Maps and Charts**: Developed dynamic, version-selectable tables and visualizations to enable intuitive data exploration and comparison.
- **State Timeline Graph**: Visualized and monitored GPU usage across company hardware to support deeper analysis and optimization of experiment performance.

## Technologies Used Web App #1

- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, enabling dynamic frontend backed by the NoSQL backend.
- **RESTful API**: Implemented HTTP-based CRUD operations to enable seamless communication between client and server.
- **Docker**: Containerized applications for faster, consistent, and automated startup across development and deployment environments.

## Technologies Used Web App #2

- **PostgreSQL**: Designed and queried relational databases to support efficient data storage, retrieval, and integrity for backend services.
- **Grafana**: For building custom dashboards to visualize real-time metrics and trends, enabling monitoring and analysis of system performance.

## Challenges and Learnings

The fast paced environment where my goal is to push out as much content as possible provided for a more stressful experience. Coming into this internship with no prior fullstack experience, I had to learn everything from scratch from what a database is to making a RestAPI for CRUD operations. 

## Outcome

Though it was tough learning the concepts and putting it into practice, I feel now that my range of knowledge has widened and I am able to pick up more technologies easier. I hope that now with my data visualizations, the team is able to present their experiements in a more easily digestible manner.
