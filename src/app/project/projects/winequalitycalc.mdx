## Overview

Simplifying the challenges faced by amateur winemakers in crafting exceptional red wine from home

## Key Features

- **Interactive Sliders**: Allow users to input wine characteristics (alc %, Sulphate, Citric Acid, Volatile Acidity) in a user-friendly way to immediately see the impact on predicted quality.
- **Simple/Clean UI**: Designed with clarity and simplicity in mind to ensure users of all technical levels can navigate and utilize the tool.
- **Customer First Approach**: Built for amateur winemakersâ€”prioritizing ease of use, practical insights, and educational value.
- **Machine Learning Basis**: Powered by a linear regression model trained on real wine quality datasets, offering accurate, data-driven predictions tailored to the user's inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **SingleStore**: For notebook and collaboration capabilities.
- **React**: Used to create the frontend of our website.
- **Sci-kit**: Trained 4 different ML models and chose the best performing one in our website.
- **Pandas**: To hold the kaggle dataset given to us through the competition.

## Challenges and Learnings

Everyone was given the same dataset and given this, our challenge we faced was how to differentiate ourselves from the rest given 
vague instructions. Our approach took the customer's side rather than our own goals. We decided to cater the website towards the 
users and create a simple yet impactful tool for amateur winemakers. From working on the project and through judge feedback, we 
learned that making the customer happy takes precedence over our own satisfaction.

## Outcome

2nd place prize at 2024 SingleStore x Data Science UCSB x Coders SB Datathon
