## Overview

I explored different methods such as changing the split size, number of bounding boxes, optimizer, or all at once.

## Key Features
- Implemented experiments with varying dataset split sizes to analyze generalization performance.

- Tuned the number of bounding boxes to balance detection accuracy and computational cost.

- Tested multiple optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD) to compare convergence behavior.

- Conducted combined experiments by altering multiple hyperparameters simultaneously.

- Evaluated model accuracy and efficiency using standardized metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**: Core deep learning framework for model implementation and training.

- **Python**: General scripting, experimentation, and data handling.

- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing bounding boxes and plotting performance metrics.
