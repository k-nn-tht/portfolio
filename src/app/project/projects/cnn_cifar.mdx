## Overview

Making a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch to Classify CIFAR-10.

## Key Features

- **Image Classification**: Achieved ~68% accuracy with a standard CNN, and ~73% with a deeper Residual CNN (ResCNN).
- **Model Comparison**: Compared different architectures and training strategies to improve performance.
- **Visualization**: Plotted loss curves and accuracy metrics for evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**: For model building, training, and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training loss and accuracy.

## Challenges and Learnings

Training deep models on CIFAR-10 introduced challenges like overfitting and slow convergence. I learned to address these through:
- Using batch normalization and dropout for regularization.
- Experimenting with optimizers and learning rates.
- Improving model architecture with skip connections in ResCNN.

## Outcome

Successfully trained models that achieved satisfactory accuracy on CIFAR-10.
