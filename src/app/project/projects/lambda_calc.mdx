## Overview

Built a recursive interpreter for untyped lambda calculus expressions in OCaml, focusing on beta reduction, substitution, and expression evaluation.
Part of Programming Languages Class

## Key Features

- **AST Design**: Defined a recursive algebraic data type to represent lambda terms (`Var`, `Abs`, `App`).
- **Beta Reduction**: Implemented evaluation logic that recursively applies functions to arguments via substitution.
- **Substitution**: Created a substitution function that carefully handles variable binding and avoids capture through alpha-renaming techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **OCaml**: For its strong type system, pattern matching, and recursive data structure support.

## Challenges and Learnings

Handling variable capture and correct substitution was particularly challenging. I had to learn techniques like alpha-renaming and scope-aware substitution. This deepened my understanding of recursion, functional programming semantics, and expression evaluation.

## Outcome

The interpreter successfully evaluates lambda calculus expressions and demonstrates the core computational model behind functional languages. This project gave me a foundational understanding of interpreters and substitution mechanicsâ€”knowledge that's transferable to language design, compilers, and functional programming frameworks.
