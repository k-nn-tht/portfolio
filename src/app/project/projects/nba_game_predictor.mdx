## Overview

Using Machine Learning to preedict the outcome of an NBA game.

## Key Features

- **Time-series Based Predictions**: The model was trained on time-series data and 3-game lag.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Integrated an automated process that translates Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and pre-built component templates. This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.

## Technologies Used

- **BeautifulSoup**: Used to web scrape team statistics from Basketball Reference over the past 5 NBA seasons.
- **Jupyter Notebook and Panads**: Handled data cleaning, transformation, and analysis for preparing inputs to  the random forrest model.
- **Sci-kit**: Utilized for building my random forrest machine learning model based on historical NBA data.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was fetching the data through webscraping and cleaning and aligning it across multiple NBA seasons while ensuring consistency in team names and season formats. Through this, I gained valuable experience in handling real-world messy datasets, working with machine learning pipelines, and developing sports analytics models with practical applications.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a working NBA prediction tool capable of estimating game outcome.
