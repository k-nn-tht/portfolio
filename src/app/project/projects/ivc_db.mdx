## Overview

In this project, my friend and I worked together to map out entities and relations, coded out the OracleDB tables and insertions, and developed a command-line interface to simulate college course registration.

## Technologies Used

- **Oracle DB**: For designing the database schema, creating tables, and storing course registration data.
- **SQL**: Used for writing queries, insertions, and managing entityâ€“relationship mappings.
- **Java**: Implemented the command-line interface, connected to OracleDB using JDBC, and handled business logic for course registration.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing a table structure to represent the entities and relationships within a college was a complex task that required extensive planning and iteration. I went through several trial runs, using example cases and test scenarios to validate the model. This process taught me the importance of thorough planning and strong test coverage.

## Outcome

My team created a working database with CLI functionality for a mock college.
