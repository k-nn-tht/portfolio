## Challenges and Learnings

Designing a table structure to represent the entities and relationships within a college was a complex task that required extensive planning and iteration. I went through several trial runs, using example cases and test scenarios to validate the model. This process taught me the importance of thorough planning and strong test coverage.

## Outcome

My team created a working database with CLI functionality for a mock college.
