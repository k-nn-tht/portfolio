## Overview

A tool to help policymakers identify the best locations for solar energy infrastructure, ultimately contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.

## Key Features

- **Interacive Map**: Visualize solar feasibility, enabling users to explore energy potential across the U.S. in an proactive and digestable way.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning model that forecasts solar energy output based on features such as temperature, rain averages, solar refraction, etc.
- **Chatbot**: Uses predicition to prompt users to ask more about a specific county, leading to a more immersive and knowledgeable experience.
- **Real Data**: Utilized NREL and NASA databases for reliable data to train our model on, giving the project a real-world basis.

## Technologies Used

- **XGBoost**: Used for building the core predictive model that estimates solar energy potential based on environmental and location-based features.
- **React.js and Flask**: For building the front-end and back-end functionality and utilizing dynamic predicitive modeling.
- **Groq**: Powered the chatbotâ€™s natural language capabilities to allow smooth, fact-aware conversations with users about solar feasibility.
- **NREL and NASA API**: Provided real-time and historical data on solar radiation, cloud cover, temperature, and other environmental factors critical to the accuracy of the model.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and team collaboration, allowing organized development.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge in this project was acquiring and processing reliable data to accurately predict solar feasibility across the U.S. Many APIs had strict rate limits or restricted access to high-resolution data. To overcome this, we optimized our algorithms to work efficiently with limited data and adjusted our web features to cache and re-use results intelligently. This experience taught us the importance of balancing technical constraints with user experience and deepened our understanding of working with APIs and predictive modeling under limitations.

## Outcome

Our team took home the "Overall Winner" prize of UCSB's 2025 Datathon, DataOrbit!
