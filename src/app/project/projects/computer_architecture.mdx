## Overview

This tab covers the computer architecture course, CS154, where we coded out many parts of the computer architecture using registers and memblocks using MIPS assembly code.

## Technologies Used

- **MIPS**: A low-level programming language that directly interacts with the MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor architecture
