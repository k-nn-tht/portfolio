## Overview

Creating a fully functional web application for real estate rent and equity forecasting.

## Key Features

- **Predicitive Modeling**: Led the AI/ML Team and Tested multiple different models ranging from linear regression to model chaining auto-regressive models into random forrest predictors.
- **Data Gathering and Feature Engineering**: Extensive Real Estate research to find free correlated time-series data engineered. Transformed raw features into structured, model-ready inputs for improved predictive accuracy.
- **Fullstack Workflows**: Collaborated closely with the fullstack team in creating end-to-end application workflows including database querying and Google OAuth through Supabase.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Scikit, ARIMA, Facebook Prophet**: For model experimentation to find the best combination of predictive models.
- **Supabase**: For Google OAuth and SQL database functionality.
- **Git**: For team collaboration, issue assignment, and code merging.

## Challenges and Learnings

The challenge of this project was definitely the collaboration of different students of different backgrounds. The skill levels of each person was different which made it hard to communicate and work on tasks in a smooth manner. In addition to this, a vague description of the project
was given leaving us with only our knowledge and creativity to fill in the gaps. I learned that with team projects such as this, communication is key because without it, others can only guess your thoughts on a topic. Whether it's a simple "Could you explain in a different way" or "I don't have much experience but I will do my best to learn," it helps the team understand your position with a given task.

## Outcome

Our web application is now being used as an internal tool within the company for short term(1-3 years) rent and equity forecasting for real estate investments. I belive that this projects has contibuted to this company greatly and fullfills my goal of making a meaningful impact within a company.
